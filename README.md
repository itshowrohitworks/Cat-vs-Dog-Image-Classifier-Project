### Project: Cats vs Dogs Classifier

**Objective**: Develop a machine learning model to classify images of cats and dogs.

**Dataset**: Kaggle's Cats vs Dogs dataset, containing labeled images of cats and dogs.

**Dataset URL** : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/salader/dogs-vs-cats

**Approach**:
1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Import and visualize the dataset to understand its structure and distribution.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Resize images to a uniform shape (e.g., 128x128 pixels).
   - Normalize pixel values to a range of 0 to 1.
   - Apply data augmentation techniques (e.g., rotation, flipping, zooming) to increase dataset variability.
3. **Model Architecture**: 
   - Build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using Keras or TensorFlow.
   - Typical layers include convolutional layers, pooling layers, and dense layers.
4. **Model Training**: 
   - Compile the model with a suitable loss function (e.g., binary cross-entropy) and optimizer (e.g., Adam).
   - Train the model on the dataset for a specified number of epochs, using a validation split to monitor performance.
5. **Model Evaluation**: 
   - Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Visualize training and validation loss/accuracy to assess model behavior.
6. **Visualization**: 
   - Display confusion matrices and ROC curves to better understand model performance.
   - Plot training and validation metrics over epochs to identify overfitting or underfitting.

**Conclusion**: The project effectively demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques to image classification tasks. It provides a robust model for distinguishing between images of cats and dogs, highlighting the capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in computer vision.
